# Second-Task

### 1. **Html Form**
A basic registration form consisting of the following fields:
- **First name** and **Last name** (Text input)
- **Email** (Email input)
- **Gender** (Radio buttons for Male and Female)
- **City** (Dropdown selection with options Amman, Zarqa, and Other)
- **Sign Up** button (Submit button)

This form allows users to input their personal details and sign up.

### 2. **Html List**
A list explaining different back-end technologies, structured as follows:
- **Back-end**
  - **Python**
  - **PHP**
    - **Laravel**

This list highlights different back-end technologies and their respective frameworks.

### 3. **HTML Table (Table Num. 2)**
A table with the following structure:
- The first column spans 2 rows (`Row 1-2, Col 1`).
- The second and third columns in rows 2 and 3 are merged, with `Row 2-3, Col 2-3` spanning 2 columns.
- The fourth row combines columns 3 and 4 (`Row 4, Col 3-4`).

The table displays merged cells using the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes to control the structure.

### Key Concepts:
- **Form Elements**: Used for collecting user data (text input, radio buttons, select dropdown).
- **Lists**: Ordered and unordered lists (nested lists) to organize information.
- **Tables**: Created using `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes to merge cells and define table structure.
